# k8s-tray

A Mac menu bar application for monitoring Kubernetes cluster health and status.

## Features

- **Health Status Indicator**: Color-coded menu bar icon showing cluster health
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: All pods running and healthy
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Some pods in warning states (pending, terminating)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Critical issues (failed pods, crashes)
- **Cluster Information**: Quick access to cluster name, version, and context
- **Pod Status**: Real-time pod counts and status overview
- **Namespace Switching**: Easy namespace selection from dropdown menu
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable polling interval for status updates
- **Multi-cluster Support**: Switch between different Kubernetes contexts

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15 or later
- kubectl configured with access to your Kubernetes cluster
- Valid kubeconfig file

### Download

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/k8s-tray/k8s-tray/releases)
2. Extract the archive
3. Move `k8s-tray` to your Applications folder or `/usr/local/bin`

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mattlqx/k8s-tray.git
cd k8s-tray

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build the application for current platform
make build

# Build for macOS (creates proper app bundle)
make build-darwin-app

# Run the application
./dist/k8s-tray
```

### macOS App Bundle

For macOS, it's recommended to use the app bundle instead of running the raw binary:

```bash
# Build the macOS app bundle
make build-darwin-app

# Run the app bundle
open "dist/K8s Tray.app"

# Or install to Applications folder
cp -r "dist/K8s Tray.app" /Applications/
```

**Important**: On macOS, the system tray functionality requires the application to be packaged as a
proper `.app` bundle. Running the raw binary directly may not show the menu bar icon. Always use the
app bundle for macOS deployment.

### Troubleshooting macOS

If the menu bar icon doesn't appear:

1. Make sure you're using the `.app` bundle, not the raw binary
2. Check macOS Security & Privacy settings if the app is blocked
3. See [macOS Troubleshooting Guide](docs/MACOS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed help

## Configuration

k8s-tray uses a YAML configuration file located at `~/.k8s-tray.yaml`. The configuration
file is created automatically with default values on first run.

### Configuration Options

```yaml
# Kubernetes configuration
kubeconfig: ~/.kube/config      # Path to kubeconfig file
context: ""                     # Kubernetes context (empty = current context)
namespace: "default"            # Default namespace to monitor

# Polling configuration
poll_interval: 5s               # How often to refresh cluster status

# UI configuration
show_notifications: true        # Show desktop notifications
theme: "auto"                   # Theme: auto, light, dark

# Feature flags
show_metrics: true              # Show resource metrics (if available)
show_logs: false                # Show log viewer (future feature)
show_events: true               # Show recent events (future feature)
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run directly
./k8s-tray

# Run with custom kubeconfig
KUBECONFIG=/path/to/config ./k8s-tray

# Run with specific context
./k8s-tray --context=my-cluster
```

### Menu Options

- **Status**: Shows current cluster health status
- **Cluster**: Displays cluster name and version
- **Namespace**: Shows current namespace
- **Pods**: Pod count summary
- **Switch Namespace**: Dropdown to select different namespace
- **Refresh**: Manually refresh cluster status
- **Settings**: Open configuration (future feature)
- **Quit**: Exit the application

### Status Indicators

| Color | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Healthy | All pods running, no issues detected |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Warning | Some pods pending, creating, or terminating |
| ðŸ”´ Red | Critical | Failed pods, crashes, or other critical issues |
| âš« Gray | Unknown | Unable to connect or determine status |

### Architecture

k8s-tray follows a modular architecture:

- **Configuration Layer**: Handles application settings and kubeconfig management
- **Kubernetes Layer**: Manages cluster connections and API interactions
- **Tray Layer**: Handles system tray integration and menu management
- **UI Layer**: Future extensibility for settings dialogs and detailed views

### Adding Features

1. Create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) in the `adrs/` directory
2. Implement the feature following the existing patterns
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation
5. Submit a pull request

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
go test -race -cover ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/kubernetes/
```

### Code Quality

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

- **Go formatting**: gofmt and goimports
- **Linting**: golangci-lint with comprehensive rules
- **Security scanning**: gosec
- **Commit messages**: Conventional commit format
- **Documentation**: Markdown linting and spell checking

### Cross-compilation
