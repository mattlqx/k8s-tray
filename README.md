# k8s-tray

A Mac menu bar application for monitoring Kubernetes cluster health and status.

## Features

- **Health Status Indicator**: Color-coded menu bar icon showing cluster health
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: All pods running and healthy
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Some pods in warning states (pending, terminating)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Critical issues (failed pods, crashes)
- **Cluster Information**: Quick access to cluster name, version, and context
- **Pod Status**: Real-time pod counts and status overview with detailed breakdowns
- **Namespace Switching**: Easy namespace selection from dropdown menu (including "All Namespaces")
- **Context Switching**: Switch between different Kubernetes contexts seamlessly
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable polling interval for status updates (5s to 5min)
- **Multi-cluster Support**: Full support for switching between different Kubernetes contexts
- **Cross-platform**: Native system tray integration for Windows (ICO), macOS, and Linux
- **Windows Optimization**: Platform-specific ICO format icons for proper Windows system tray integration

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**:
  - Windows 10/11
  - macOS 10.15 or later
  - Linux (various distributions with system tray support)
- kubectl configured with access to your Kubernetes cluster
- Valid kubeconfig file

### Download

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/k8s-tray/k8s-tray/releases)
2. Extract the archive
3. Move `k8s-tray` to your Applications folder or `/usr/local/bin`

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mattlqx/k8s-tray.git
cd k8s-tray

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build the application for current platform
make build

# Build for macOS (creates proper app bundle)
make build-darwin-app

# Run the application
./dist/k8s-tray
```

### macOS App Bundle

For macOS, it's recommended to use the app bundle instead of running the raw binary:

```bash
# Build the macOS app bundle
make build-darwin-app

# Run the app bundle
open "dist/K8s Tray.app"

# Or install to Applications folder
cp -r "dist/K8s Tray.app" /Applications/
```

**Important**: On macOS, the system tray functionality requires the application to be packaged as a
proper `.app` bundle. Running the raw binary directly may not show the menu bar icon. Always use the
app bundle for macOS deployment.

### Troubleshooting macOS

If the menu bar icon doesn't appear:

1. Make sure you're using the `.app` bundle, not the raw binary
2. Check macOS Security & Privacy settings if the app is blocked
3. See [macOS Troubleshooting Guide](docs/MACOS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed help

## Configuration

k8s-tray uses a YAML configuration file located at `~/.k8s-tray.yaml`. The configuration
file is created automatically with default values on first run.

### Configuration Options

```yaml
# Kubernetes configuration
kubeconfig: ~/.kube/config      # Path to kubeconfig file
context: ""                     # Kubernetes context (empty = current context)
namespace: "default"            # Default namespace to monitor

# Polling configuration
poll_interval: 5s               # How often to refresh cluster status

# UI configuration
show_notifications: true        # Show desktop notifications
theme: "auto"                   # Theme: auto, light, dark

# Feature flags
show_metrics: true              # Show resource metrics (if available)
show_logs: false                # Show log viewer (future feature)
show_events: true               # Show recent events (future feature)
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run directly
./k8s-tray

# Run with custom kubeconfig
KUBECONFIG=/path/to/config ./k8s-tray

# Run with specific context
./k8s-tray --context=my-cluster
```

### Menu Options

- **Status**: Shows current cluster health status
- **Cluster**: Displays cluster name and version
- **Namespace**: Shows current namespace
- **Pods**: Pod count summary
- **Switch Namespace**: Dropdown to select different namespace
- **Refresh**: Manually refresh cluster status
- **Settings**: Open configuration (future feature)
- **Quit**: Exit the application

### Status Indicators

| Color | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Healthy | All pods running, no issues detected |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Warning | Some pods pending, creating, or terminating |
| ðŸ”´ Red | Critical | Failed pods, crashes, or other critical issues |
| âš« Gray | Unknown | Unable to connect or determine status |

## Platform-specific Notes

### Windows

K8s Tray is designed for optimal Windows integration with proper ICO format icons for full system tray compatibility.

#### Making the Icon Visible

On Windows, the k8s-tray icon may be hidden in the notification area overflow by default. To make it always visible:

1. **Find the hidden icon**: Look for the `^` arrow icon in your system tray and click it to see hidden icons
2. **Pin the icon**: Drag the K8s Tray icon from the hidden area to the visible tray area
3. **Configure Windows settings**:
   - Right-click on an empty area of the taskbar
   - Select "Taskbar settings"
   - Click "Select which icons appear on the taskbar"
   - Find "k8s-tray" and turn it "On"

#### Troubleshooting Windows Icon Issues

If the icon is not visible or the app doesn't appear in the taskbar settings:

1. **Check if the app is running**: Look in Task Manager for `k8s-tray.exe`
2. **Run with administrative privileges**: Try running as administrator (right-click â†’ "Run as administrator")
3. **Restart Windows Explorer**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` to open Task Manager
   - Find "Windows Explorer" and click "Restart"
4. **Check Windows version compatibility**: Ensure you're using a supported Windows version (Windows 10/11)
5. **Antivirus interference**: Some antivirus software may block system tray integration

The application includes helpful tooltips and a "Help" menu item on Windows with detailed instructions.

For more information, visit Microsoft's guide: [How to customize the taskbar notification area](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-customize-the-taskbar-notification-area)

### macOS

The application appears in the macOS menu bar and should be visible by default. If you don't see it, check if your
menu bar is full and consider reducing the number of menu bar items.

### Linux

System tray behavior varies by desktop environment. Some older desktop environments may require additional packages
like `snixembed` to properly display the tray icon.

### Architecture

k8s-tray follows a modular architecture with comprehensive cross-platform support:

- **Configuration Layer**: Handles application settings and kubeconfig management
- **Kubernetes Layer**: Manages cluster connections and API interactions
- **Tray Layer**: Handles system tray integration and menu management with platform-specific optimizations
- **UI Layer**: Future extensibility for settings dialogs and detailed views

**Cross-Platform Design**: The application supports Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-specific
optimizations including ICO format icons for Windows and proper app bundle support for macOS.
See [ADR-003](adrs/003-cross-platform-support.md) for detailed cross-platform architecture decisions.
