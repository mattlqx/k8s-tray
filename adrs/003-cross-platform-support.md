# ADR-003: Cross-Platform Support Strategy

## Status

Accepted - Implemented

## Date

2025-07-14

## Context

The k8s-tray application was initially designed for macOS as a menu bar application. However,
to maximize adoption and provide value to the broader Kubernetes community, we need to extend
support to Windows and Linux platforms. This requires careful consideration of platform-specific
system tray implementations, icon formats, user interface paradigms, and build/deployment
strategies while maintaining feature parity across all supported platforms.

## Decision

We will implement comprehensive cross-platform support targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux
operating systems for both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures. The application will maintain
consistent functionality across all platforms within the constraints of the underlying
system tray libraries and platform-specific requirements.

## Platform-Specific Implementation Details

### System Tray Integration

#### Library Choice: fyne.io/systray

We have chosen `fyne.io/systray` as our cross-platform system tray library because:

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Active maintenance**: Regular updates and bug fixes
- **Go-native**: Pure Go implementation with minimal CGO dependencies
- **Feature completeness**: Supports icons, tooltips, menus, and notifications
- **Community adoption**: Widely used in the Go ecosystem

#### Platform-Specific Behaviors

**Windows System Tray:**

- Uses Windows Shell API for system tray integration
- Requires ICO format icons for proper display and taskbar settings integration
- Supports rich tooltips with multi-line text
- Integrates with Windows notification area settings
- Respects Windows theme settings (light/dark mode)

**macOS Menu Bar:**

- Uses Cocoa/AppKit frameworks for menu bar integration
- Supports both regular and template icons for dark/light mode adaptation
- Requires proper app bundle structure for full functionality
- Integrates with macOS accessibility features
- Supports macOS-specific UI conventions

**Linux System Tray:**

- Uses DBus and StatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator specifications
- Compatibility varies by desktop environment:
  - GNOME: Requires extensions for system tray support
  - KDE Plasma: Native system tray support
  - XFCE: Built-in system tray support
  - i3/sway: Requires compatible status bar
- May require additional packages (e.g., `snixembed`) for older environments

### Icon Format Strategy

#### Platform-Specific Icon Formats

**Windows:**

```go
func createICOIcon(r, g, b uint8) []byte {
    // Generate ICO format icon with:
    // - 16x16 pixel size for system tray
    // - 32-bit BGRA color format
    // - Proper ICO header structure
    // - AND mask for transparency
}
```

**macOS:**

```go
func createPNGIcon(r, g, b uint8) []byte {
    // Generate PNG format icon with:
    // - 16x16 pixel size for menu bar
    // - RGBA color format
    // - Transparency support
    // - Template icon support for dark mode
}
```

**Linux:**

```go
func createPNGIcon(r, g, b uint8) []byte {
    // Generate PNG format icon with:
    // - 16x16 pixel size for system tray
    // - RGBA color format
    // - Transparency support
    // - Desktop environment compatibility
}
```

#### Runtime Icon Selection

```go
func createSimpleIcon(r, g, b uint8) []byte {
    if runtime.GOOS == "windows" {
        return createICOIcon(r, g, b)
    }
    return createPNGIcon(r, g, b)
}
```
